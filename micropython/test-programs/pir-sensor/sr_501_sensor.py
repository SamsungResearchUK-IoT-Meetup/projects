    """
    A pythonic PIR (Passive Infrared Sensor for the SR-501) driver for micropython

    The driver sets an interrupt for the PIR sensor when initialised. The constructor will try and use pin X1 if it is not
    instantiated with a Pin value. If an interrupt is already being used on that Pin the object will raise an exception. In
    this instance the application layer has to deal with this.
    Once the object is created it will call the 'callback' function passed in when being created. If none is given a default
    callback is used which simply outputs text to the screen.

    The PIR object has internal state for:
     - number of activations since it was active.
     - the time stamp in UCT time when the object was created.
     - a method to deactivate the interrupt on the pin
     - a method to get stats from the PIR object
     - a method to start the interrupt on the given pin.
     - a method to manually pole the PIR to see if it is active or not.
